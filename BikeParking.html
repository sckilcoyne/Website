<h2>How does bike parking make the city better?</h2>
<p>What holds people back from choosing to bike for utility and transportation? People need to know, without thinking too hard, that biking is a reasonable choice to get to their destination. The most obvious reason people don’t bike is because they don’t feel safe. BCU Labs has our Stress Map that shows what every street segment feels like to ride on. BCU and other advocacy organizations have been successful in getting the cities and state agencies to build safer bike lanes, which has been shown to increase biking rates over [link to Garden St] and over [link to Boston bike report] and over [link to Cambridge bike report] again.</p>
<p>But having safe bike lanes is not the only thing cyclists need to think about when deciding to take a trip. They also need to know they can securely lock up their bike at their destination. Car drivers have it easy, nearly every street has parking for them and there are numerous parking lots. America has XXXX parking spots per person, meaning there is ample parking for drivers. But we have not built out bike parking with the same zeal.</p>
<p>The BlueBikes system makes it easy to know where you can park your bike, just open the app and navigate to your destination and the app will direct you to the nearest station to your destination. However, people using personal bikes need to know there is parking at their destination before they set out, or risk needing to insecurely park their bike, often on sign posts that obstruct sidewalks.</p>
<p>BCU has in the past called out parking equity being a major shortcoming of Boston [link to report].</p>
<p>To help elevate this issue and help cyclists know where bike parking is throughout the region, BCU Labs is excited to add new data layers to our Stress Map.
You can now see where active BlueBike stations are and clicking on them will show you the current count of bikes, e-bikes, and docks.
And you can also see where bike parking has been mapped. If you click on a rack, you can see more details, including capacity and rack style. Of note, much of the city we believe is under-mapped. This makes our map less helpful for cyclists and prevents us from performing accurate analyses on parking equity. You can add missing bike parking locations easily when you are around town, just follow the instructions here [link to how-to article].</p>
<p>If you know of somewhere that desperately needs more bike parking, here is how to formally request from each city:
Boston
Cambridge
Somerville
Brookline
DCR</p>
<p>Research what cities look at for street parking distance from a street - if they are looking at street parking removal for a bike lane and give a percentage of parking lost, how far off-corridor do they look? I think it was 2 spaces for Broadway. What is the half the distance of the shortest block plus length of parking off-corridor? This is what cities are effectively saying is an acceptable walking distance from a destination is.</p>
<p>Research how much bike parking is added by each city per year. Calculate the parking/sq mi rate for each city.</p></div><footer><div class="foot"><div class="text"><a href="/Website">BCU Labs</a> is a volunteer-led project of <a href="https://bostoncyclistsunion.org/">Boston Cyclists Union</a></div><div class="text"><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSefzxEQ-CAbJd_rrt90DHvdglYvP9RLqdDUVsFq28onw9xXJQ/viewform">Join BCU Labs here</a></div><div class="Pad"><a href="https://secure.everyaction.com/mfRgF-hjuEueYqUtvn9Jeg2"><button class="Button Donate">Donate</button></a></div></div></footer></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{}},"page":"/BikeParking","query":{},"buildId":"PVWLhoQQDAAjEW8slRfj4","assetPrefix":"/Website","nextExport":true,"autoExport":true,"isFallback":false,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
