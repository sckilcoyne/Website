# How to map bike parking in OpenStreetMap
There are many apps that allow you to map features in OSM. Below are a few of the easiest apps to get started and how to specifically use them to add bike parking to OSM.

You can read more about *why* bike parking is <Link to={ROUTES.BIKEPARKING_PAGE_ROUTE} >crtical to map here</Link>.

For all of the options below, you will need an account on OSM. You can sign up [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/new) now or each of these apps will link you there when you open them. 

## StreetComplete - Android only
[StreetComplete](https://streetcomplete.app/) is a smartphone app for editing OpenStreetMap and is currently only available for Android.


Upon opening the app the map will show your location with nearby objects with questions to be answered highlighted. You can change the default settings to remove "quests" that you aren't interested in answering.
