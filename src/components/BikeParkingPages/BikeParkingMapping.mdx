# How to map bike parking in OpenStreetMap
There are many apps that allow you to map features in OSM. Below are a few of the easiest apps to get started and how to specifically use them to add bike parking to OSM.

You can read more about *why* bike parking is <Link to={ROUTES.BIKEPARKING_PAGE_ROUTE} >crtical to map here</Link>.

For all of the options below, you will need an account on OSM. You can sign up [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/new) now or each of these apps will link you there when you open them. 

## StreetComplete - Android only
[StreetComplete](https://streetcomplete.app/) is a smartphone app for editing OpenStreetMap and is currently only available for Android.


Upon opening the app the map will show your location with nearby objects with questions to be answered highlighted. You can change the default settings to remove "quests" that you aren't interested in answering.

## EveryDoor - Apple/Android
[Every Door](https://every-door.app/) is a smartphone app for adding points of interest such as bicycle parking to OpenStreet Maps available for both Apple and Android.


Step-by-step instructions for adding unmapped bike parking
<div className="image-slider-container">
<Slider {...single_settings}>
    <div className='slide_div'>
        <img src='./OSM_instructions/everydoor/1.png' alt="Every Door Step 0" className='slide_img'/>
        To view where existing bicycle parking is marked in OpenStreet Maps, select the tree icon and update the map for your location to show existing features. This view will indicate bike parking if any is nearby along with some other options marked on the map. The image above shows the area at the intersection of Boylston St and Tremont St. Three points marked as bicycle parking are shown on Boylston Street and within the park. Note that the colors for icons may not be the same for each user.
    </div>
    <div className='slide_div'>
        <img src='./OSM_instructions/everydoor/1.png' alt="Every Door Step 1" className='slide_img'/>
        To add the location of bicycle parking choose the blue plus sign button in the lower right of the screen. This will open a new window to prompt to choose the location to be added (see next slide). 
    </div>
    <div className='slide_div'>
        <img src='./OSM_instructions/everydoor/2.png' alt="Every Door Step 2" className='slide_img'/>
        Once you have moved the pin to the location you would like to add an un-mapped instance of bicycle parking, click the blue checkmark in the lower right.
    </div>
    <div className='slide_div'>
        <img src='./OSM_instructions/everydoor/3.png' alt="Every Door Step 3" className='slide_img'/>
        Select *Bicycle Parking amenity=bicycle_parking* as the type of marker to be added either by choosing from the common options or by searching for this term in the *Choose type…* search box
    </div>
    <div className='slide_div'>
        <img src='./OSM_instructions/everydoor/4.png' alt="Every Door Step 4" className='slide_img'/>
        This will open a prompt about details of the bicycle parking including: type, capacity, operator, whether the parking is covered, open to the public, free or for a fee and more. Within the additional options whether the parking is indoor or outdoor, lit by lights, and on a level surface are relevant fields. Images can also be added in the additional options.

        The type of racks installed by the city of Boston are known by several names including post-and-ring lollipop, bollard, post and hoop, post and loop, and are also described by several existing terms in the field type including *bollard*, *post_hoop*, and *post_loop*

        Once you have selected information for the fields you wish to complete, choose the green *Save* button at the bottom of the list.
    </div>

        <img src='./OSM_instructions/everydoor/5.jpg' alt="Every Door Step 5" className='slide_img'/>
        Once you have saved the new bike parking, you need to submit your changes to OpenStreetMap. You can do this by clicking the up arrow on the left of the bottom toolbar on the map screen. You can add multiple items and submit them all at once if you wish.

## MapComplete - Web
[MapComplete](https://mapcomplete.org/) simplifies the interface for adding types of features (themes) to OSM.They have a theme just for [bike parking](https://mapcomplete.org/bicycle_parkings.html?z=12.9&lat=42.351653695129585&lon=-71.06010161014677) and another that includes bike parking and other useful features and [amenities for cyclists](https://mapcomplete.org/cyclofix.html?z=12.6&lat=42.34600576339486&lon=-71.08348986228737). The steps are the same for each, but we will focus on just the bike parking theme here.

        Congrats! You just edited OpenStreetMap. If you added bike parking, you can refresh [link to stressmap] in a few minutes and see it added to our map.

        From here, you can learn how to edit existing features and improve the map in other ways. The Stress Map uses OSM data to calculate street ratings. [link to what tags we use for LTS calcs]. Unlike bike parking, any street changes you make will take a few days to appear on our Stress Map, when we recalculate the ratings.
