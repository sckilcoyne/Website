# How we analyze an intersection
For this project, BCU Labs volunteers manually evaluate every intersection. These are called "Audits" and versions of this activivity are common within street advocacy communities and planning professionals. 

<Link to={PINX_PAGE_ROUTE} >Here</Link> is where you can learn more about *why* protected intersections are so critical to street safety.

## Where we evaluate
We are only currently evaluating intersections where a bike/mobility lane has been installed on the street. This keeps us focused to where the city has already put effort to improve safety to see if they have fallen short of world-class design. As plans for new projects are presented, it is critical that the community understand what the prevailing design standards are and if the city is designing to those or not. We hope that this page can help educate you on what to look for in these designs and demand better of our city.

You can see which intersections <Link to={INX_PAGE_ROUTE} >we have audited here</Link>.

## Corner separation

## Bike lane separation

## Crosswalk separation (a.k.a. “daylighting”)
